-- 1) 
-- I would use numeric(4, 1) because no driver travels more than 999 miles 
-- and we need an accuracy of one digit after the decimal point
-- therefore precision must be 4 and scale of 1
-- We use fixed decimals instead of floating for better accuracy

-- 2) 
-- last_name varchar(30)
-- first_name varchar(25)
-- We will use varchar so as to accommodate for varying lengths of names
-- We must separate the first and last names for more flexible data querying/analysis/handling down the line

-- 3)
-- We should get an error since the format is not correct for a timestamp data type
